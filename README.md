# FamilyMap Server Project

This project for BYU's CS 240 course involves creating a server for the FamilyMap application, which provides users with a visual representation of their family history on a map.

## Project Overview

**FamilyMap** is a client-server application. The **FamilyMap server** is responsible for user authentication, family history data storage, and generating artificial family history data. The server accepts HTTP requests, processes them, and responds with appropriate data, interacting with a local SQLite database.

---

### Components

1. **Server**: Core component handling HTTP requests and database operations.
2. **Handlers**: Maps incoming URL paths to specific functions.
3. **Services**: Contains server functionalities (e.g., logging in, retrieving family data).
4. **SQLite Database**: Stores user, person, event, and authentication data.
5. **DAOs**: Data Access Objects provide methods for database interaction.
6. **Models**: Represents data objects stored in database rows.
7. **Requests & Responses**: Handles data input and output from client to server.

### Key Concepts

- **User Authentication**: Users must log in and receive an authorization token for secure data access.
- **Data Persistence**: All server data persists in an SQLite database, including user, person, event, and auth data.
- **Family History Generation**: The server generates up to four generations of ancestor data upon user registration or a `fill` request.

---

## Server Requirements

The server includes several endpoints to manage data:

- **/user/register**: Registers a new user, generating family history data for them.
- **/user/login**: Authenticates the user, issuing an authorization token.
- **/clear**: Deletes all data from the server's database.
- **/fill/[username]/{generations}**: Generates ancestor data up to the specified number of generations.
- **/load**: Replaces existing data with new user, person, and event data.
- **/person/[personID]**: Returns details for a specific person.
- **/person**: Returns all family members of the current user.
- **/event/[eventID]**: Returns details for a specific event.
- **/event**: Returns all events related to the userâ€™s family.

### JSON Data Structure

Each endpoint handles request and response data in JSON format, with strict requirements to match specific structures for testing and validation.

## Development Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Starter Project**: Use the provided [IntelliJ starter project](https://github.com/jerodw/FamilyMapServerStudent) with pre-set configurations for testing.
2. **Command-Line Arguments**: The server requires a port number to accept client connections (e.g., `8080`).

### Automated Unit Testing

Use JUnit 5 to create a minimum of two test cases per public method in DAO and Service classes:
- **Positive Tests**: Valid inputs returning expected results.
- **Negative Tests**: Invalid inputs triggering errors or edge cases.

Example:
- Testing successful login (`positive` case).
- Testing failed login with incorrect password (`negative` case).

### Test Suite & Pass-Off

1. **Test Suite**: Run the included test suite to validate server functionality.
2. **Pass-Off**: Once all tests pass, request a TA pass-off.
3. **Submission**: Submit source code and a screenshot of passing test results on Canvas.
